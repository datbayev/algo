# How to win technical interview

There are many aspects of the technical interviews.
Successful interviews are not just about coding up a problem you're given.
It is also about having a good communication with the interviewer, showing your technical skills, ability to solve
system design architecture type of challenges, and many others.

Typical interview consists of 3 main parts:
- introduction
- problem solving
- asking questions

**Introduction** is an ice-breaker of the interview. Usually interviewer would quickly talk about current team he/she
is working on, and maybe some details of the current/recent project. The same is expected from you. Depending on the
type or stage of the interview, you maybe asked a ton of follow-up questions about the project you've worked on with
deep technical aspects. So be ready in advance to have at least 1 or 2 projects that you know very well. Know the
numbers, think about key facts and metrics, this will help you showing that you really know what you did, and the other
way around, if you'll struggle with this and could tell that you don't really know what you've worked on.

The "beef" of the interview is mainly about 2nd part, which is a problem **solving**.

After interviewer gives you a problem make sure you:
- clarify the problem
- ask enough amount of questions so that you really understand the problem
- talk through and repeat problem statement so that interviewer confirms you got it right
- go through at least one test

Before start coding:
- if you know optimal solution already, go for it and explain it
- if not, first think of brute-force/most obvious solution
- don’t code it right away, but instead just explain your solution and provide time/space complexity
- ask interviewer if he/she’s ok with that; if not, say that you’re thinking about more optimal solution
- once you find optimal algorithm go for coding

During the coding:
- think out loud
- write concise and easy to read code
- DRY: assume you have a function, quickly write it’s signature, and implement it later
- give variables meaningful names

More stuff:
- are you happy with the solution?
- clearly mention UNIT INTEGRATION FUNCTIONAL TESTS, just said out loud these words so that interviewer sees that you're
aware of this.
- communication is very important, make sure you are on the same page with interviewer
- most of the problems are much simpler that you think they are, don't overthink it
