# How to win technical interview

There are many aspects of the technical interviews.
Successful interviews are not just about coding up a problem you're given.
It is also about having a good communication with the interviewer, showing your technical skills, ability to solve
system design architecture type of challenges, and many others.

Typical interview consists of 3 main parts:
- introduction
- problem solving
- asking questions

**Introduction** is an ice-breaker of the interview. Usually interviewer would quickly talk about current team he/she
is working on, and maybe some details of the current/recent project. The same is expected from you. Depending on the
type or stage of the interview, you maybe asked a ton of follow-up questions about the project you've worked on with
deep technical aspects. So be ready in advance to have at least 1 or 2 projects that you know very well. Know the
numbers, think about key facts and metrics, this will help you showing that you really know what you did, and the other
way around, if you'll struggle with this and could tell that you don't really know what you've worked on.

The "beef" of the interview is mainly about 2nd part, which is a problem **solving**.

After interviewer gives you a problem make sure you:
- clarify the problem
- ask enough amount of questions so that you really understand the problem
- talk through and repeat problem statement so that interviewer confirms you got it right
- go through at least one test

Before start coding:
- if you know optimal solution already, go for it and explain it
- if not, first think of brute-force/most obvious solution
- don’t code it right away, but instead just explain your solution and provide time/space complexity
- ask interviewer if he/she’s ok with that; if not, say that you’re thinking about more optimal solution
- once you find optimal algorithm go for coding

During the coding:
- **think out loud**, with this you'll show the path of your thoughts.
- **dominate the discussion**, keep asking, talking, suggest ideas, the more the better, don't stop thinking and keep
driving the interview.
- **details are important**, interviewers pay attention to small details which you're going through during your thinking or
implementation. For instance, why would you prefer BFS over DFS instead just choosing one.
- **give "insights" of the problem**, if you catch some corner cases or some other interesting cases which could affect your
solution, talk about them, show your knowledge, the whole interview is an opportunity to shine, use every possible
chance
- **write concise and easy to read code**, try to make nice with proper indentations
- in some cases you might want to assume that you have a function, quickly write it’s signature, and implement it later
- give variables meaningful names, but don't spend much time on this thinking about perfect name, it's good to have it,
but not necessarily a must.
- once you have at least one working solution ask if interviewer is happy with the solution
- clearly mention in real-world you would write a bunch of **unit/integration/functional tests**, just said out loud these
words so that interviewer sees that you're aware of this. There's no other way during interview to show that you know
something about testing other than just talking about it.
- **communication is crucial**, make sure you are on the same page with interviewer. If you're unsure about something, don't
be shy/afraid to ask for clarifying that points. It's better to double-check rather than solving wrong problem.
- most of the interview problems are much simpler than you think they are, don't overthink them. Start simple, then keep
optimizing and deepening into whatever you have already.
