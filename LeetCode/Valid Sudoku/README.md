# Valid Sudoku problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/

Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: [Sudoku Puzzles - The Rules](http://sudoku.com.au/TheRules.aspx).

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

Note: a valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.
