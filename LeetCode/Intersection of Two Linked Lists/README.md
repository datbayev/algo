# Intersection of Two Linked Lists

https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```

Notes:
- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
