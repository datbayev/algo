# Longest Increasing Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

For example,
Given ```[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],```
The longest increasing subsequence is ```[2, 3, 7, 101]```, therefore the length is ```4```. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in ```O(n^2)``` complexity.
